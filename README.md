VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street
# Objectives
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year (2018) and (2017) for each run and take the following information:
Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
The total stock volume of the stock
Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red
Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once
# VBAStocks
StockSummary.VBS - Uses For Loops to move through all of the stocks in the data set, tracks the changes and prints out the totals on a Summary Table. A For Loop is also included that enables script to run through every sheet in the workbook.
